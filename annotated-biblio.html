                        <p>[Ann 1] Yang, X. and Tian Y., Robust Door Detection in Unfamiliar Environments by Combining Edge and Corner Features. <em>IEEE Computer Society Workshop on Computer Vision Applications for the Visually Impaired, 2010.</em></p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em"><strong>Synopsis</strong>: In this paper, they go over the current limitations and room for research in the area of helping visually-impaired people explore unfamiliar indoor environments. Indoor door-detection is difficult because of large intra-class variations of appearance and design and relatively small inter-class variations of different object models.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em">The researchers develop a geometric model by combining edges and corners to determine the concavity of the object. Concave objects (doors and elevators) are separated from convex objects (bookshelves and cabinets) by integrating the lateral information of  a detected doorframe to obtain the depth information with respect to the wall. The researchers wanted to direct the user by using audio queues. To obtain the relative position of the door to the user, they use the angle formed by the horizontal bar (of the detected doorframe) and the horizontal axis of the image.</p>

                        <p>[Ann 2] Chen, Zhichao and Birchfield, Stanley T., Visual Detection of Lintel-Occluded Doors from a Single Image. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2008. CVPRW '08. IEEE Computer Society Conference on. </p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em"><strong>Synopsis</strong>: As an introduction to their paper, they go over two visual cues that have been used by previous papers: intensity edges to detect the sides (posts) and top (lintel) of the door, and the average door color which is assumed to be different from that of the surrounding wall.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em">Their approach uses a single image and five features. Weak classifiers based on these 5 features are combined using Adaboost to produce a strong classifier. Their assumptions are that both door posts and visible in the image, the camera is oriented so that the posts appear nearly vertical, and the door is at least a certain width. The features they look for are pairs of vertical lines, the concavity of the detected shape, the gap below the door, the color, and a kick plate.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em">Their algorithm detect 20 doors out of 22 in the corridor they tested, with 100% accuracy for the ones detected (10/10 times each). The ones that weren’t detected were due to an occluding water fountain and the other wasn’t detected because it was flush with the wall.</p>

                        <p>[Ann 3] Kim, S., Cheong, H., Kim, D. H., Park, S., Context-based Object Recognition for Door Detection. 15th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR), 2011.</p>

                        <p style="margin-left:2em"><strong>Synopsis</strong>: In this paper, they go over context-based door-finding for a robot. They use the robotic context (height of the stereo cameras) and the average height of doorknobs to help them. They also detect two different types of doorknobs, which were straight and round ones. As an introduction to their paper, they went over both range sensor-based door detection methods and vision-based door detection methods. </p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em">For their methodology, they create a region of interest to look for doors. They want to find vertical lines so to extract vertical lines, they used a moving window to scan an edge image along the x axis to build a histogram of edges. The width of the moving window is set wide enough to cover inclined vertical lines. Next, they look for the doorknob. To recognize the doorknob they used an affine category shape model, which uses object shapes only. They trained the model and used a feature matching algorithm to recognize the doorknobs.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left:2em">Their results reported a 100% door detection rate, though some false positives were present (1/102 for handled doors and 5/189 for knobbed doors).</p>
